# js-learning-journey

A collection of JavaScript mini-projects and learning logs to showcase my journey from beginner to expert.

## 🚀 JavaScript Learning Journey – Web Development Course

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository, a structured showcase of my progress through the core and advanced concepts of JavaScript as part of my full-stack web development training. This repo not only documents my hands-on experience but also reflects my commitment to becoming a proficient frontend/backend developer ready for real-world challenges.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a collection of exercises, challenges, and mini-projects designed to solidify my understanding of modern JavaScript. Every concept here has been implemented with practical code and real application logic.

## 🧑‍💻 **Why this repo matters for you (as a hiring manager):**

It reflects my consistent dedication, hands-on skill development, and ability to translate theory into working, interactive applications.

## 📚 What I’ve Learned

### ✅ JavaScript Basics
- Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Data types (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined)
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do while`)
- Functions (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)
- Scopes (global, block, function)
- Arrays and Objects
- Built-in methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.)
- Template literals

### 🧠 Intermediate JavaScript
- Callback & Higher-order functions
- Timers: `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`
- `this` keyword & binding
- Object-Oriented Programming
  - Constructor functions
  - Prototypes
  - ES6 Classes
- Error handling (`try/catch/finally`)

### 🌐 DOM Manipulation
- Element selectors and traversal
- Styling and class manipulation
- Dynamic content creation
- Event handling and delegation

### 🎮 JavaScript Mini-Projects
These projects are coded from scratch to reinforce concepts:

```
