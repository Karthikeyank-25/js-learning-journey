// Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?
// var a = "3";
// var b = "8";
// So that the variable a holds the value "8".
// And the variable b holds the value "3".
// When the code is run, it should output:
//   a is 8
//   b is 3
// Do NOT change any of the existing code.
// You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.
// You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.

// Solution :
    var a = "3";
    var b = "8";
    
    var c;          //declaring variable "c"
    var c = a;
    var a = b;
    var b = c;

    console.log("a is "+a);     // a is "8"
    console.log("b is "+b);     // b is "3"
